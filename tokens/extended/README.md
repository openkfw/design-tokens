# Style-Dictionary Extended Design Tokens

The script `build.ts` generates design tokens (JSON files) based on your reference and the object to be extended. It uses the lodash library to merge the data and json5 to read and write JSON5 files. By using extends, the light version is set as the baseline, as deviating themes like "dark" only change minimally.

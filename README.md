# KfW Design Tokens

![KfW Design Tokens](/kfw-design-tokens.png)

KfW Design Tokens is the source of truth for designing KfW-branded digital products. By default, it's built to align with our corporate brand and design but allows for customization to fit your particular product.
The tokens follow a template that complies with the <a href="https://tr.designtokens.org/">W3C DTCG format</a>.

**Note: The Design Tokens are still in the pilot phase.** This means that they are currently being tested and evaluated for functionality and usability. Feedback from users during this phase is crucial for making improvements and ensuring that the tokens meet the needs of all stakeholders before a full stable release.

## üíÅ FAQ

### How to use fluid typography with design tokens?

Fluid typography allows font sizes to scale dynamically based on the viewport size, creating a responsive and adaptable user experience. KfW Design Tokens include predefined fluid typography settings that you can directly use in your projects.

For example, you can apply the following CSS variables with clamp:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(var(--kfw-fontsize-heading-1-min), var(--kfw-fontsize-heading-1-val), var(--kfw-fontsize-heading-1-max));
}
```

This ensures that the `h1` font size adjusts fluidly between the minimum and maximum values defined in the design tokens, depending on the viewport width ‚Äî the minimum value on mobile, scaling up to the maximum value on desktop.

### How to use breakpoint design tokens with @media and CSS?

Currently, CSS variables cannot be used directly in media query declarations. However, the W3C is working on the [Custom Media Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#at-ruledef-custom-media).
As a workaround, you can extract your variables into @custom-media rules and generate your CSS using the PostCSS plugin `postcss-custom-media`. A sample integration can be found in the `/demo` directory.
Otherwise you can use the static `px` values provided in the design tokens.

### How to use breakpoint design tokens width @media and Tailwind CSS?

In Tailwind CSS v3, you can define breakpoints directly in your `tailwind.config.js` using JavaScript.  
In Tailwind CSS v4, you can either use the <a href="https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#using-sass-less-or-stylus">SCSS preprocessor</a> with variables for breakpoints, or use the standard CSS version with the workaround described above.

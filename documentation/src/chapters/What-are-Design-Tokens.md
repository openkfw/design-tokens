# What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are structured, machine-readable design decisions in JSON format that can be integrated into various
applications. They promote consistent product development and reduce errors when handing off designs to development, as
developers can select predefined tokens. Additionally, tokens enable global updates that automatically apply across all
projects. The principle of Atomic Design, already established at KfW, is extended through the so-called design tokens
layer.
